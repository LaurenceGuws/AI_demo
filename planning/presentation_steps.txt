Here's a rough outline of the structure the presentation:

1. **Introduction**
    - Briefly explain what Large Language Models (LLMs) are and their capabilities.
    - Discuss the role of AI in software development.
    - Share some examples of how AI is currently being used in the industry.

2. **Benefits of Using LLMs in Software Development**
    - Improved efficiency: LLMs can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up developers to focus on more complex problems.
    - Enhanced accuracy: AI can help identify bugs and vulnerabilities in the code, improving the overall quality of the software.
    - Personalized user experience: AI can be used to understand user behavior and personalize the software accordingly.

3. **Demo App**
    - Showcase the AI tools you use in your daily work.
    - Walk through the process of integrating an LLM into a demo app.
    - Highlight how the LLM improves the functionality of the app.

4. **Do's and Don'ts of Using AI in Software Development**
    - Discuss the ethical considerations of using AI.
    - Talk about the importance of data privacy and security.
    - Highlight the need for human oversight and the risk of over-reliance on AI.

5. **Conclusion**
    - Recap the key points of the presentation.
    - Discuss the future of AI in software development.
    - Open the floor for questions and discussion.

For the demo app, it would be helpful if you could provide more details about the kind of app you'd like to create, the AI tools you use, and how you'd like to integrate the LLM into the app. This will help me provide more specific guidance and suggestions.
