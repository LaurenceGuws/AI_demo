Welcome to the future! This application aims to give us the oppertunity to explore LLM API's and open sourced models as a team!
Implementing an additional API into the app will be as simple as writing a class and adding it to the models folder (more details below). Were as hosting
a local model will still be added.''

== Features 🚀
